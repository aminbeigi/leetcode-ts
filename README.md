## Description

Solving LeetCode questions to strengthen my understanding of DSA.

I've decided to solve LeetCode problems using TypeScript, a language I'm working
to become more proficient in. While I previously used Python, I now prefer
TypeScript because its flexible type system makes it easier to understand and
manage data which leads to more intuitive and less error-prone problem solving.

My main goal is to complete the [NeetCode 150](https://neetcode.io) problem set
along with other stuff I find interesting or fun.
